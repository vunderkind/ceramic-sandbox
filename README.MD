## A friendly introduction to Ceramic
First, we're going to install Ceramic on our computer with the following command:
`npm install -g @ceramicnetwork/cli`
(This is a very long install, or perhaps my bandwidth was iffy again)

If all's gone well, that allows us to fire up a local Ceramic node on our computer with the following command:
`ceramic daemon`

`localhost:7007` should now be fired up and ready for use.
